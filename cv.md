## About myself:  
In my school years I loved to make up web pages. But when he grew up he got a job as a video editor, and later as a photographer.  
This is where my conflict was born. At my place of work, the element of creativity disappeared, so I decided that video and photography will remain my hobby, and I will change my profession.  
So remembering my school hobby, I decided to try my hand at frontend and I think my perseverance will help me succeed.
